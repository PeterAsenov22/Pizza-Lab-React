# Project Specification

**“Pizza Lab”** is a web application for a Pizza restaurant. The client side is a single page app, dynamically updating with **React**, using **JSX**, **React JS** and **Bootstrap**. The server is built on **Express JS** and it is using **Mongo Db** for storing the data. **Redux** is used as a state management library. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. The application consists of users, pizza products and orders. Each user can register, login and logout. Users can also search for the pizza they are looking for, view each pizza details and make orders. Admins can add, edit and delete pizza entries and approve orders.
